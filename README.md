# STM32F446RE Peripheral Driver Development

This project focuses on writing low-level drivers for various peripherals of the STM32F446RE microcontroller. The drivers are implemented entirely from scratch in C by referring to the STM32F446RE reference manual and datasheets. The goal is to provide a comprehensive set of peripheral drivers, including GPIO, RCC, I2C, UART, and SPI, offering direct control over the hardware.
